SIDBlaster driver wrapper:
==========================
Web-Site: http://crazy-midi.de/joomla/index.php/home/myprojects/elctronicp/58-sidblaster

This driver is a wrapper around the original USB driver functions contained in hardsid.dll
provided by Stein Pedersen (https://csdb.dk/release/?id=136549)
It makes it possible to use the native HardSID driver via Java Native Interface (JNI).

Note:
SIDBlaster USB driver (hardsid.dll) is only available as a 64 bit version.

Create the DLL for Windows on Ubuntu Linux:
===========================================
We do cross-compilation here, therefore install:
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

In Eclipse CDT change Project/Properties (add OpenJDK include paths to both compilers)
C/C++ Build

Click on Menu/Project/Build All
Copy JSIDBlaster.dll to JSIDPlay2 directory
src/main/resources/sidblaster_builder/win64/Release

Test:
=====
Windows is guest in Virtual Box, Ubuntu Linux is host:
Launch Windows
Install Java 64-Bit
Connect SIDBlaster-USB device to your real computer.
Allow Windows to use USB hardware with Virtual box Toolbar icon in the bottom right side of the window.
Your user has to be a member of the group: vboxusers to let virtualbox access USB hardware.
Start JSIDPlay2 and switch from Emulation to SIDBlaster.
Check console, that there are no error messages.

Enjoy!
