/**
 * An implementation of the BNDM algorithm with wildcards ("don't care"
 * symbols). The wildcard character is initially '?', but any character can be
 * used through the {@link #processChars(char[], char)} and the
 * {@link #processBytes (byte[], byte)} methods. <br>
 * <br>
 * This algorithm is around five times faster than
 * {@link com.eaio.stringsearch.ShiftOrWildcards}. <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Preprocessing: O(2m + &sum;) time
