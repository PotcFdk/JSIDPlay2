/**
 * 
 * The audio output stage in a Commodore 64 consists of two STC networks, a
 * low-pass filter with 3-dB frequency 16kHz followed by a high-pass filter with
 * 3-dB frequency 16Hz (the latter provided an audio equipment input impedance
 * of 1kOhm).
 * <P>
 * The STC networks are connected with a BJT supposedly meant to act as a unity gain buffer, which is not really how it works. A more elaborate model would include the BJT, however DC circuit analysis
 * yields BJT base-emitter and emitter-base impedances sufficiently low to produce additional low-pass and high-pass 3dB-frequencies in the order of hundreds of kHz. This calls for a sampling
 * frequency of several MHz, which is far too high for practical use.
