Hi!

>(I am referring to the way he implemented ring modulation on SID).

The way he implemented ring modulation is definitely common technique.  
Analogue ring modulation requires 4 diodes and 2 transformers, there you  
need a lot of cleverness to achieve a grade of modulation of 1. (I don't  
know the right translation of "Modulationsgrad".) On the other hand,  
digital ring modulation is so incredible cheap, just swapping the high bit  
of the oscillators and a few XORs and the work is done.

IMHO the only true clever thing Bob did is to decide what functions/ 
features should go into silicon and which not. He didn't put in useless or  
redundant things blocking lots of chip space like Peddle did with the  
decimal mode in the 6502.

It was interesting to read, it cleared up some minor things about how the  
SID works. There are just two points in the interview that made me wonder:

#1 He defined the possibility to playback digitized samples as feature and
   not as bug. So it was only CBM being so stupid to think it was a bug
   and removed the volume register change click in later SIDs. So now it's
   official confirmed that they removed a feature and not a bug.

#2 He said that random plus waveform can result in an empty shifter,
   because of the way the outputs are multiplexed. That's very obscure. Of
   course he used wired AND, but he must separate the outputs of each
   waveform generator from each other by MOS FETs anyway. And FETs use to
   work in input->output direction only.

Yes, that's hard to understand, especially why does it sit at zero?

I think I should measure it too, but until today when I acquired a new  
"old" C64, I had no C64/SID combination I could trust...

Neat.

No. But it will surely sound odd.
