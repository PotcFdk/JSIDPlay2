Sorry for my ignorance, but as I haven't heard before about that
mailing-list, I would like you to send me some related info, e.g. how to
subscribe (e.g. ADD ?) ... is this possible ?

Month ago I asked George W.Taylor for verification of the following,
which is required to correctly replay some sidtunes.

- in front of the Attack-phase there is a delay of 32 milliseconds, if
the SID Attack-value is different from the Release-value

- between Decay-phase and Release-phase there is a delay von 32
milliseconds, if the SID Decay-value is different from the Release-value

I could not correctly determine, whether the delay is always 32 ms or
sometimes up to 32 ms. Inspite of this, the delay seems to be regular.
Without, some notes are noticably shorter.

Digitizing the SID chip output **again** ?? I rather tried to examine
the combined waveforms with an oscilloscope at the Uni's Experimental
Physics Laboratory. But that was when I had access to the equipment. Now
I don't. Of course I wanted to find a way to calculate the resulting
waveform. Since I didn't succeed and was terribly fed up hacking and
combining functions, I used a *real* AND for a long time without
examining its result. It didn't even sound like it could come close to
the SID. We know why ! Later I decided to use an array of samples, which
have a similar characteristic sound in comparison to the real SID. At
least the output came somewhat closer.

Digitizing the SID output by connecting the C64 to a PC soundcard at
least gives the opportunity to take a look at the waveform
characteristic. One thing is clear, for sure. A pulsewidth of zero (0)
must be used to see the full waveform. Would mean, the pulse (square)
waveform is nearly always of the value 255. A Pulsewidth of 2048 ($800)
only shows the second part, which is the mirrored first half from
0-2048. A distant relation to the triangle waveform can be discovered.
The axis of the mirror is put where the triangle wave reaches its peak
value.

Concerning the other SID chip revisions, I'm still trying to persuade my
friend to compile his old C64 equipment upon time. He has moved and left
some of his old hardware at his family's and his younger brother's
place. My C64 with MOS-6581R4 is available, though. But as my overall
SID emulation is still far from perfect (I still find me calling it
approximization), I doubt, that later SID chip revisions would reveal
something spectacular. For instance, the R7 chip completely f*cked up
occasionally, so it might also be damaged (Note: It was once taken out
of the C64 and put into Roger Dahl's LPT1 hardware SID board, which had
some flaws, but worked approx. 98% (?)).

I still think, the inconsistencies just result in a somewhat
stronger/weaker filter effect, nothing severe. Instead, I would be happy
to learn more about the mapping of the SID filter value and the real
filter frequency. The docs state: SIDvalue = (freq-30)/5.8182 Hz. But
simply really is neither linear, nor exponential nor logarithmic.
Christian Bauer told me, he approximizes via a second grade Taylor
polynom, I'm using a clipped exponential approach. Bandwidth of the
band-pass filter would be interesting, too.
