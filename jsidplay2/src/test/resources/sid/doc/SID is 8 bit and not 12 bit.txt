One thing: the sid output has only 8-bit resolution.

You can see and hear this yourself if you try this small program:

       lda #$81
       sta $d404+14    ;start noise waveform in voice 3
       lda #$00
       sta $d401+14    ;frequency 1
       lda #$01
       sta $d400+14
       
       sei
l1      lda $d011       ;wait till raster off screen to avoid crash
       bpl l1         ;with buggy VICs
       and #$ef
       sta $d011       ;turn off screen
       
l2      lda $d41b       ;read output of voice 3 waveform
       sta $d020       ;and change color of screen accordingly
       jmp l2

Turn up your volume on your tv-set and watch the screen. You will hear
that the sound changes only when the color on the screen also changes. 
Since the readout of voice 3 is 8 bit, the real output can't possibly 
have better resolution, because then you would hear more ticks than 
changes of the color on your screen.

You can try it with other waveforms too, and you'll find the same
result. However, you might have to tie pin 26 (EXT IN) to ground
to get a much clearer sound of the SID to be able to hear the
clicks.
