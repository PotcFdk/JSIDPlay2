The result of the ANE opcode is A = ((A | CONST) & X & IMM), with CONST apparently
608	 	 being both chip- and temperature dependent.
609	 	 
610	 	 The commonly used value for CONST in various documents is 0xee, which is however
611	 	 not to be taken for granted (as it is unstable). see here:
612	 	 http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=6502_Opcode_8B_(XAA,_ANE)
613	 	 
614	 	 as seen in the list, there are several possible values, and its origin is still
615	 	 kinda unknown. instead of the commonly used 0xee we use 0xff here, since this
616	 	 will make the only known occurance of this opcode in actual code work. see here:
617	 	 https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2110948&group_id=223021&atid=1057617
			(see file Spectipede_1006.tap)
618	 	 
619	 	 FIXME: in the unlikely event that other code surfaces that depends on another
620	 	 CONST value, it probably has to be made configureable somehow if no value can
621	 	 be found that works for both.
