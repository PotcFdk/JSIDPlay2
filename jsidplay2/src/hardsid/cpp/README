Fake HardSID driver:
====================
It emulates the existence of one or more HardSID sound cards (http://www.hardsid.com/).
The first 8 devices are handled by communication via socket connection
with the Java Virtual Machine running JSIDPlay2.
That means all SID writes are transferred to JSIDPlay2 and executed
in the SID emulator environment.
Additionally, the fake HardSID driver loads the original driver
of a HardSID4U sound-card and puts all real devices on top
of the fake devices. Therefore, a software like ACID64,
that is able to use HardSID4U as an output device
detects up to 16 devices:
8 jsidplay2 fake devices
+4 HardSID PCI card real devices
+4 HardSID4U USB devices
The available number of devices depends on
the actual number of real devices connected to your Computer.
