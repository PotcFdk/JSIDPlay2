Feature to compare VICE and JSIDPlay2 via socket connection after each instruction.
Implemented to compare Edge of Disgrace.
Some synchronization start has been found, where both implementations are exactly at
the same state. From here on the compare their states each instruction fetch until a difference has
been detected. VICE sends its state to JSIDPlay2 and JSIDPlay2 compares with its own state.

Build VICE (with debug settings):
=================================
Checkout source code of vice with eclipse, repository location:
https://svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/tags/v3.1/
open a terminal
cd /home/ken/workspace/vice
# install eventually missing Ubuntu packages (e.g. my Ubuntu 17.10)
sudo apt-get install byacc flex libpng-dev libreadline-dev libxaw7-dev texinfo
# create configure script
./autogen.sh
# create makefiles with debug enabled and without optimizations
./configure --enable-debug CFLAGS='-g -O0' CXXFLAGS='-g -O0'
# create executables
make

# install a visual debugger
sudo apt-get install kdevelop
# start debugger
kdevelop
# Create new project using vice as main directory
Open project
Choose vice root dir
Run/Configure Launches...
Create New
Executable: /home/ken/workspace/vice/src/x64sc
# Enable line numbers for breakpoint settings
Settings => configure editor => appearance => borders => tick show line numbers
Set breakpoint in mainc64cpu.c: 744
Start Debug from toolbar



patch mainc64cpu.c in the src folder

make

Debug EoD using VICE:
=====================
ddd --args x64sc -autostart "/home/ken/workspace/jsidplay2/src/test/resources/demos/dontwork/EdgeOfDisgrace_1a.d64"

File/Open Source...
"Type" main*
"Select" mainc64cpu.c
"Click" Open

Strg+F 246171754
"Click"

Set Breakpoint:
===============
"Right Click at the left side of the editor"
"Set Breakpoint"

(Order is important here!)
1. Start JSIDPlay2Frame (beforehand: Use MOS6510ViceSync.class instead of MOS6510.class in Player.java's constructor)
2. In DDD (Debugger) for VICE click run

Comunication is via socket connection (port=6510)
