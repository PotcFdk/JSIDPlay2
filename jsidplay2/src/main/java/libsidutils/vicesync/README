Feature to compare VICE and JSIDPlay2 via socket connection after each instruction.
Implemented to compare Edge of Disgrace.
Some synchronization start has been found, where both implementations are exactly at
the same state. From here on the compare their states each instruction fetch until a difference has
been detected. VICE sends its state to JSIDPlay2 and JSIDPlay2 compares with its own state.

Build VICE:
===========
cd /home/ken/Downloads/vice-2.4
# install eventually missing Ubuntu packages (e.g. my Ubuntu 15.10)
sudo apt-get install libxt-dev libxaw7-dev libreadline-dev
# enable debug symbols
./configure CFLAGS='-g' CXXFLAGS='-g'
# Remove optimization flags from all Makefiles: e.g. -O2
<do it with your favorite editor here!>

cp mainc64cpu.c into the src folder

make
sudo make install

Fix directories once:
=====================
sudo mv /usr/local/lib64/vice /usr/local/lib/

Debug EoD using VICE:
=====================
ddd --args x64sc -autostart "/media/readyshare/Ken/c64/JSIDPlay2/eod bug/EdgeOfDisgrace_1a.d64"

File/Open Source...
"Type" main*
"Select" mainc64cpu.c
"Click" Open

Strg+F 246171754
"Click"

Set Breakpoint:
===============
"Right Click at the left side of the editor"
"Set Breakpoint"

(Order is important here!)
1. Start JSIDPlay2Frame (beforehand: Use MOS6510ViceSync.class instead of MOS6510.class in Player.java's constructor)
2. In DDD (Debugger) for VICE click run

Comunication is via socket connection (port=6510)
