	 * Lookup table to convert from attack, decay, or release value to rate
	 * counter period.
	 * <P>
	 * Rate counter periods are calculated from the Envelope Rates table in the Programmer's Reference Guide. The rate counter period is the number of cycles between each increment of the envelope
	 * counter. The rates have been verified by sampling ENV3.
	 * <P>
	 * The rate counter is a 16 bit register which is incremented each cycle. When the counter reaches a specific comparison value, the envelope counter is incremented (attack) or decremented
	 * (decay/release) and the counter is zeroed.
	 * <P>
	 * NB! Sampling ENV3 shows that the calculated values are not exact. It may seem like most calculated values have been rounded (.5 is rounded down) and 1 has beed added to the result. A possible
	 * explanation for this is that the SID designers have used the calculated values directly as rate counter comparison values, not considering a one cycle delay to zero the counter. This would
	 * yield an actual period of comparison value + 1.
	 * <P>
	 * The time of the first envelope count can not be exactly controlled, except possibly by resetting the chip. Because of this we cannot do cycle exact sampling and must devise another method to
	 * calculate the rate counter periods.
	 * <P>
	 * The exact rate counter periods can be determined e.g. by counting the number of cycles from envelope level 1 to envelope level 129, and dividing the number of cycles by 128. CIA1 timer A and B
	 * in linked mode can perform the cycle count. This is the method used to find the rates below.
	 * <P>
	 * To avoid the ADSR delay bug, sampling of ENV3 should be done using sustain = release = 0. This ensures that the attack state will not lower the current rate counter period.
	 * <P>
	 * The ENV3 sampling code below yields a maximum timing error of 14 cycles.
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 *      lda #$01
	 *  l1: cmp $d41c
	 *      bne l1
	 *      ...
	 *      lda #$ff
	 *  l2: cmp $d41c
	 *      bne l2
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * This yields a maximum error for the calculated rate period of 14/128 cycles. The described method is thus sufficient for exact calculation of the rate periods.

	 * The 16 selectable sustain levels.
	 * <P>
	 * For decay and release, the clock to the envelope counter is sequentially divided by 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 1 to create a piece-wise linear approximation of an exponential. The exponential counter
	 * period is loaded at the envelope counter values 255, 93, 54, 26, 14, 6, 0. The period can be different for the same envelope counter value, depending on whether the envelope has been rising
	 * (attack -> release) or sinking (decay/release).
	 * <P>
	 * Since it is not possible to reset the rate counter (the test bit has no influence on the envelope generator whatsoever) a method must be devised to do cycle exact sampling of ENV3 to do the
	 * investigation. This is possible with knowledge of the rate period for A=0, found above.
	 * <P>
	 * The CPU can be synchronized with ENV3 by first synchronizing with the rate counter by setting A=0 and wait in a carefully timed loop for the envelope counter _not_ to change for 9 cycles. We
	 * can then wait for a specific value of ENV3 with another timed loop to fully synchronize with ENV3.
	 * <P>
	 * At the first period when an exponential counter period larger than one is used (decay or release), one extra cycle is spent before the envelope is decremented. The envelope output is then
	 * delayed one cycle until the state is changed to attack. Now one cycle less will be spent before the envelope is incremented, and the situation is normalized.
	 * <P>
	 * The delay is probably caused by the comparison with the exponential counter, and does not seem to affect the rate counter. This has been verified by timing 256 consecutive complete envelopes
	 * with A = D = R = 1, S = 0, using CIA1 timer A and B in linked mode. If the rate counter is not affected the period of each complete envelope is
	 * <P>
	 * (255 + 162*1 + 39*2 + 28*4 + 12*8 + 8*16 + 6*30)*32 = 756*32 = 32352
	 * <P>
	 * which corresponds exactly to the timed value divided by the number of complete envelopes.
	 * <P>
	 * <P>
	 * From the sustain levels it follows that both the low and high 4 bits of the envelope counter are compared to the 4-bit sustain value. This has been verified by sampling ENV3.
