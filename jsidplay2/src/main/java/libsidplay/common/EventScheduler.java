/**
 * Fast EventScheduler, which maintains a linked list of Events. This scheduler
 * takes neglible time even when it is used to schedule events for nearly every
 * clock.
 * 
 * Events occur on an internal clock which is 2x the visible clock. The visible
 * clock is divided to two phases called phi1 and phi2.
 * 
 * The phi1 clocks are used by VIC and CIA chips, phi2 clocks by CPU.
 * 
 * Scheduling an event for a phi1 clock when system is in phi2 causes the event
 * to be moved to the next phi1 cycle. Correspondingly, requesting a phi1 time
 * when system is in phi2 returns the value of the next phi1.
