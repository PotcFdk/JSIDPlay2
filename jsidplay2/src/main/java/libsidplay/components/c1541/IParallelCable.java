/**
 * Parallel cable is a custom modification between C64 and C1541, connecting the
 * two via C64's user port and extra wiring attached to the one of the VIA
 * chips. In addition of 8 data lines, 2 signal wires are connected to let both
 * parties be aware of when the other is ready.
 * 
 * The pulse() is used to indicate the drive that C64 is ready; the signal is
 * constructed by the CIA automatically on any use of register PRB.
 * 
 * The other direction is handled via the handshake parameter on the
 * driveWrite().
