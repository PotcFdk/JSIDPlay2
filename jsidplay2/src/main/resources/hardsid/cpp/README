Fake HardSID driver:
====================
It emulates the existence of one or more HardSID sound cards (http://www.hardsid.com/).
The first devices are provided by the original hardsid.dll driver provided by
www.hardsid.com
On top of the real sound card devices 8 virtual devices are added by jsidplay2.
That way one can switch between sound output using a HardSID4U sound card and the
emulation using jsidplay2.

Sound output by jsidplay2 is implemented using a socket connection (port is 6581)
to transfer all SID writes and execute them in the SID emulator environment.

Therefore, compatible software that is able to use HardSID4U as an output device
detects up to 16 devices:
up to 4 HardSID PCI card real devices
up to 4 HardSID4U USB devices
and 8 jsidplay2 fake devices
The available number of devices depends on
the actual number of real devices connected to your Computer and the availability of
a running jsidplay2 emulator.

Additional Notes:
1. Later implementation has moved the implementation of the fake devices to the external
program jsiddevice.exe
2. A 64 bit version of our driver has been added to the Debug64 folder, but the original
driver HardSID_orig.dll is not available as a 64 bit version, yet!?
