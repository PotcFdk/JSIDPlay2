== Introduction

I am a C64 fan since 1986 as many other people are. I played games, watched demos and read books, but when the time goes by, all activities stopped slowly in the beginning of the 90s. 
But one thing from the past i actually do until today, that is listening the precious SID music of all the talented music artists and demo groups. So many thanks to all of you for your work collected in the link:https://www.hvsc.c64.org/[HVSC].

To listen the new releases from the still active groups i often used link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/sidplay2/[sidplay2]  for windows or an emulator like link:https://www.ccs64.com/[CCS64] , because my commodore was on the attic.

I am a Java developer and wanted to have my very own java implementation to create a so called C64 Jukebox. 
I decided to create a 1:1 conversion of link:https://sourceforge.net/projects/sidplay2/[sidplay2] from C++ to java. It should have all features of the original.
It was a long time work and when it was finished i decided to make it open source, that others can integrate into their java emulators. +
Perhaps there will be plugins for many java apps some day or a version running even on a mobile.

Since then people have joined to develop a more complete C64 emulator to be fast, feature complete and eye-catching. Without them this project would be stuck on version 1.4 and i am very thankful for their help. In fact i hope this project will never die.

The current version has been evolved toward a full featured and very compatible C64 emulator. This was possible due to the tremendous support of the C64 community. In fact many people have supported JSIDPlay2 during its development.

*Special thanks* go to Antti S. Lankila for continued development to enhance the emulation and adding valuable features, Nata for his numerous tests and many feedback of the beta versions, Wilfred Bos for his support and bugfix of the SIDNetDevice implementation. Other people contributed valuable pieces of code just read the Credits in the player to find out. 
Thank you!

== Further possibilities

* If you want to compare the quality of this emulation with the real thing and own a link:http://www.hardsid.com/[HardSID4U] soundcard (no more available, please search on ebay),
then just download and start link:https://www.acid64.com/[ACID64] (by Wilfred Bos) the recommended music player to play SID tunes on a real SID chip
and additionally download the link:{codebase}jsiddevice-{version}.jar[Network SID Device] (part of JSIDPlay2).
Now, using ACID64 you are able to switch between the real SID chip playback and the emulation on the fly.
