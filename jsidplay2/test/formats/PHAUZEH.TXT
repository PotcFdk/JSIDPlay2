  This file is created when you save a  session  in  the  Phau  Zeh  VIC-20
emulator (written by Arne Bockholdt). Like all emulator  saved-session,  it
contains all zero-page RAM, CPU registers, RAM and I/O registers. In  order
for the Phau Zeh emulator to recognize its saved-sessions, it must be saved
with the "S20" extension.

  This document is based on the 0.9.5 revision of the S20  layout,  so  the
actual 1.0 release might be different. The minimum S20 file  size  is  9286
bytes (based on an un-enpanded VIC-20)  and  the  largest  is  36934  bytes
(based on a fully-expanded VIC-20).

   Bytes: $0000-000E - S20 signature string "VIC-20 SNAPSHOT"
                000F - S20 revision
                         $01 - version 0.9.5
                          00, 02-FF - Reserved
                0010 - Machine
                         $00 - Original VIC-20
                          01 - Phau Zeh
                          02 - V20
                          03 - Mac VIC-20 emulator
                          04-FF - Future Expansion (set to $00)
                0011 - Miscellaneous Info. If Byte $16 is set  to  1  (Phau
                       Zeh emu), it is sub-version of the emulator.
                         With $16 set to 1:
                         $01 - PZL
                          02 - PZW
                          00, 03-FF - Future expansion (set to $00)
           0012-0013 - Future Expansion (set to $00)
           0014-0015 - Memory areas saved (in HI-LO format). The  bit  will
                       be set if the memory area is saved,  clear  if  not.
                       Each bit of this  word  represents  a  4Kb  area  of
                       memory. The ROM memory locations  should  always  be
                       clear (not saved), and positions 1 and 9 must always
                       be set and saved.
                         Bit: 00 - RAM $0400-0FFF (only 3Kb for this one)
                              01 - RAM $1000-1FFF
                              02 - RAM $2000-2FFF
                              ...
                              15 - RAM $F000-FFFF
           0016-0017 - VIC-20 ROM memory (in HI-LO format). The bit will be
                       set if the ROM area is saved, clear if not. Each bit
                       represents 4Kb of ROM. VIC-20 ROM  memory  locations
                       should be set to 1, and setting  bits  0  and  1  on
                       would make no sense as  ROM  can't  exist  in  those
                       areas.
                         Bit: 00 - ROM $0000-0FFF
                              01 - ROM $1000-1FFF
