  Written by Eugene F. Barker and Ryan Vander  Stoep,  this  archiver  does
whole-disk archiving from the various Commodore drives (1541/1571/1581), as
well as the larger CMD drives (hard disks). The  latest  known  version  is
"CKIT-94", meaning it was released  in  1994.  The  compressor  program  is
commercial  and  dongle  protected,  but  the  decompressor  is  publically
available. From reports I have received the compression used is RLE,  which
is not generally very good and it is also  not  very  fast.  One  point  in
CKIT's favor is that  it  supports  all  the  presently  available  storage
devices (CMD hard disks, Commodore 15xx floppy drives).

  The file extension for single disk files (i.e.  when  a  compressed  disk
archive only takes up one archive file) is "C4-". If an compressed  archive
takes more than 1 file, the extension changes to "C4A" for  the  first  and
"C`A" for the second. I do  not  know  what  the  extensions  will  be  for
compressed files taking more than two files, but CKIT  does  allow  for  an
archive to span up to 27 disks.

  The header of the compressed file always starts  with  the  string  "MMS"
(with a  space  and  $00  null  termination)  which  stands  for  "Mad  Man
Software", the company which makes the product.
