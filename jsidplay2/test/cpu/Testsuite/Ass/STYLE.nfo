$$    Style are pleased to bring you the September'06 package of the
$$   Turbo Macro Pro toolset, including v1.2 of all assemblers.
$$   
$$    Main features added in this package include IDE64 compatibility,
$$   illegal opcodes, PTV/Hummer opcodes, a status line switcher, and
$$   a new "TMPPREFS" utility that replaces the preferences (BA+p) menu
$$   in the assembler with a separate tool that can load any v1.2 mod,
$$   alter colors, tab settings, default jumpback, separator template,
$$   and default function keys - then resave your own customized version
$$   of Turbo Macro Pro. TMPPREFS was coded by our returning ass kicker,
$$   Massive Onslaught.
$$   
$$    The most significant bug erased in v1.2 is a proper fix for the
$$   famous line-0 block kill crasher that is present in all Turbo
$$   variants. Please see the tmp-changes.txt for all details.
$$
$$    Props to our friends for their help:
$$
$$     Schema/AIC - temporary use of his IDE64 hardware at C4 expo
$$      for coding the IDE64 compatibility changes.
$$     Six/Style - more DTV/PTV testing and IDE64 hardware borrowing
$$     Macbeth/PSW - doublechecking re: SCPU 20mhz mode
$$
$$    We also thank the following for their support, feedback,
$$   suggestions and correspondance regarding Turbo Macro Pro:
