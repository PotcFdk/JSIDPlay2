Try the following:

POKE 54273,60		       (Freq)
POKE 54278,255:POKE 54276,15   (Decay/Release=15, vol=15)
POKE 54276,17		       (Triangle, set gate)

Now enter:

POKE 54276,16:POKE 54276,17

The idea is to toggle the gate bit and restart the sound, but instead
it turns it off!  Re-enter the above line, and suddenly the sound
re-appears!

Now repeat the experiment, but with POKE 54278,249.  No problem.
Clearing/setting the test bit does not alter the outcome.

So as far as I can tell, it is related to the decay cycle.  My guess
is that the gate is re-enabled before the first decrement of the gate
cycle, and that SID somehow gets confused.  And, in point of fact, this
only happens for decay=15.  Try the following:

$1000:
	LDA #$40
	STA $D401
	LDA #$FF	;Decay/Release
	STA $D406
	LDA #$0F
	STA $D418
	LDA #$11
	STA $D404
	RTS
	LDA #$10	;($1015)
	STA $D404
	LDA #$11
	STA $D404
	RTS

G 1000 and then G 1015 a few times.  Now change the decay to LDA #$EF and
repeat the experiment -- no sound shutoff!

This is on a 128D, not sure of the SID revision (a later one :).

Is this known, documented, whatever?  Any suggestions for getting around
it?  (set/clear of the test bit also fails).  The other observation is
that when the sound restarts, it restarts from the beginning, i.e if
you also set a long attack rate, when the sound restarts it will
restart from zero amplitude.

Unfortunately for my music player, this can have the effect of
completely shutting off a voice when the music restarts (I guess I'll
have to skip initializing SID).

Ah well, any comments would be appreciated.

P.S. Happy Thanksgiving to everyone in the States :)  Gobble gobble gobble!

I have encountered similiar problems while working with my music player / 
editor (The Cyberlogic Sound Studio). As far as I know, it does _not_ 
depend on the SID version you're working with.  I still have not found 
any solution nor explanation to this.

Mostly, I try to avoid this problem by not using some special envelopes 
that are affected by this phenomenon, or I use a sound with AD/SR set to 
$00 and wave set to $09 a few frames before. That should reset the voice 
so far that the volume progression of the next note won't be unpredictable.
