How to create a BIOS bin (forum post snippets):

Alternative 1:
1. Attach some trash file as bios 
2. Use the recovery diks and overwrite it 
3. Now you have a valid bios image

Alternative 2:
Let's see - right click on file, send to hex editor,
search "CBM80" (C3 C2 CD 38 30), go 4 bytes back (start/end address), cut to beginning of file,
jump to 0x2000, cut to end of file, save with new filename.
20 seconds.

Btw, we still need an image of the SD card, additionally.
These days tools like dd or WinImage are used.
FAT16 is required for that, however never MMC64 plugins support FAT32.
