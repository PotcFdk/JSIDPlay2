A ramdrive for NEO-ram and compatibles (i.e. GEOram).
NEOram being a modern batterie buffered version of georam with up to 2mb. 
Fully compatible to GEOram so you can use this with georam just as well.
The BLOCKS FREE is hardcoded to 2mb though, but can be used with 512KB.
check label "ramsize" and change i.e. to #$07 for 512 KB
Device-No is set to 2.
Use POKE 2,X to set device to X (8 also works btw)
also nice: use 1 and you can press SHIFT+RUN/STOP in directory listing!

Commands:
LOAD"$",2 for directory
LOAD"file",2(,1)
SAVE"file",2(,1)
VERIFY"file",2(,1)

further commands:
to INIT the drive use "arrow-left" as first char of filename! I.e. 
LOAD"<=",2,1 or LOAD"<=FILE",2 
will format the ram expansion.
f that happens accidentally, repair with NEOram Monitor since
only 4 bytes were overwritten

to SCRATCH a file use POUND-sign (%) as first char in filename:
LOAD"%file",2,1 
will scratch the file named "file".

Code currently at $ca00 so the LOAD-limit is about 193 blocks.
for basic loaders: about 153 blocks.

This version initialises the kicker that remains in NEOram.
You can launch it with SYS57000 or SYS57E3 anytime!
Due to the batterie buffer it is resistant and 
can be launched even after several days/weeks/months.

Also works in VICE now in case you care. (use GEOram there).

About Directory:
the entries show 1 Block even when below 1-page-size for consistency with 1541.
However BLOCKS FREE displays the real space left on neo/georam.

Also if a filename is used twice, only the first one can be accessed.

WHY?
Because other than all the hardware-stuff around: this is oldschool! This could have been done in the 80s as well. And georam aint that rare after all. You get tons of them on auctions and with the NEOram there are modern versions around...

enjoy, enthusi
