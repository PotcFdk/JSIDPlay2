HardSID driver wrapper:
=======================
This driver is a wrapper around the original USB driver functions contained in hardsid_usb.lib
provided by www.hardsid.com
It makes it possible to use the native HardSID driver via Java Native Interface (JNI).

Note:
HardSID4U USB driver (hardsid_usb.lib) is not available as a 64 bit version.

Create the DLL for Windows on Ubuntu Linux:
===========================================
We do cross-compilation here, therefore install:
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

In Eclipse CDT change Project/Properties (add OpenJDK include paths to both compilers)
GCC/C++ Compiler/Settings/Includes
GCC/C Compiler/Settings/Includes
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/include
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/include/linux
Click on Menu/Project/Build All
Copy DLL to JSIDPlay2 directory
src/main/resources/hardsid_builder/win32/release

Test:
=====
Windows is guest in Virtual Box, Ubuntu Linux is host:
Launch Windows Vista
Install Java 32-Bit
Install USB Driver (hardsidusb.*) from directory resources/driver
Press F8 on Windows boot
Choose deactivate Driver signature checks and continue booting.

In JSIDPlay2 switch from Emulation to HardSID4U.
Check console, that there are no error messages.

Hard-wire HardSID4U: connect mixed/out into the microfone/in of your computer.

In Ubuntu Linux with Pulseaudio installed transport microfone sound to speakers;
Open a terminal and type:
parec --latency-msec=1 | pacat --latency-msec=1

Enjoy!
