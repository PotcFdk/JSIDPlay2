HardSID driver wrapper:
=======================
This is the HardSID4U USB driver containing functions of hardsid_usb.lib
provided by www.hardsid.com

Note:
HardSID4U USB driver (hardsid_usb.lib) is not available as a 64 bit version.

Create the DLL for Windows on Ubuntu Linux:
===========================================
We do cross-compilation here, therefore install:
sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

In Eclipse CDT change Project/Properties (add OpenJDK include paths to both compilers)
C/C++ Build
  Settings
    GCC/C++ Compiler/Settings/Command: i686-w64-mingw32-g++
    GCC/C++ Compiler/Settings/Includes

      /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/include/linux
    GCC/C++ Linker/Settings/Command: i686-w64-mingw32-g++
Click on Menu/Project/Build All
Copy hardsid_usb.dll to JSIDPlay2 directory
src/main/resources/win32-x86/

Test HardSID4U in Virtual Box:
==============================
Windows is guest, Ubuntu Linux is host:
Launch Windows 10
Install Java 32-Bit

Alternative 1 (use unsigned drivers):
=====================================
Install USB Driver (hardsidusb.*) from directory resources/driver
Now, reboot your computer into "disable driver signing" mode.
- Press F8 on every Windows boot
- Choose deactivate Driver signature checks and continue booting.

Alternative 2 (use signed drivers)
==================================
Open a new command prompt (important: use open as Administrator)
Extract signtools.zip from directory resources/driver containing important exe files.
Please type the following commands
makecert -$ individual -r -pe -ss "Self Signed Drivers" -n CN="Self Signed Drivers" selfsign.cer
certmgr /add selfsign.cer /s /r localMachine root
signtool sign /v /s "Self Signed Drivers" /n "Self Signed Drivers" hardsidusb_x64.sys
bcdedit -set TESTSIGNING ON
Now, reboot your computer into "disable driver signing" mode and load your shining new signed driver.
You only need to boot into this "disable driver signing" mode first time you
load the driver. It should work after that without any special tricks however testsigning needs to be enabled.

Use HardSID4U:
==============
Connect HardSID4U device to your real computer.
Allow Windows to use USB hardware with Virtual box Toolbar icon in the bottom right side of the window.
Your user has to be a member of the group: vboxusers to let virtualbox access USB hardware.
Start JSIDPlay2 and switch from Emulation to HardSID4U.
Check console, that there are no error messages.

Hard-wire HardSID4U: connect mixed/out into the Microfone/in of your computer.

In Ubuntu Linux with Pulseaudio installed transport Microfone sound to speakers;
Open a terminal and type:
parec --latency-msec=1 | pacat --latency-msec=1

Enjoy!
